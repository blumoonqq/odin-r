    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Best Fudgy Chocolate Brownie Cookies are a one bowl wonder ready in minutes, and named better than a brownie cookie! They disappear in seconds!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 cup white granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup melted butter</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 1/3 cups all purpose flour (or plain flour)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/3 cup semi sweet chocolate chips, (add more if desired)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Line 2 cookie sheets or baking trays with parchment paper (baking paper).</li>
        <li>In a medium-sized bowl, mix together the cocoa powder, white sugar, butter and vegetable oil. Beat in egg and vanilla until fully incorporated.</li>
        <li>Add the flour, baking powder, and salt; stir the dry ingredients first before mixing them through the wet ingredients until a dough forms (do not over beat). Fold in the chocolate chips.</li>
        <li>Scoop out 1-2 tablespoonful of dough with a cookie scoop (or small ice cream scoop), and place onto prepared baking sheets. Press them down as thick or thin as you want your cookies to come out. </li>
        <li>Bake in hot preheated oven for 10-12 minutes. The cookies will come out soft from the oven but will harden up as they cool. (Be careful not to over bake as they will dry out.)</li>
        <li>Allow to cool on the cookie sheet for 10 minutes before transferring to wire racks to cool.</li>
    </ol>
