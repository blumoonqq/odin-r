    <h1>Moist Chocolate Muffins</h1>

    <img src="img/muffin2.WEBP">

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>These double chocolate muffins are incredibly rich, mega chocolate-y, and loaded with chocolate chips in every single bite. Sour cream helps guarantee a soft and moist muffin that has a denser texture than chocolate cupcakes.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups (250g) all-purpose flour (spoon & leveled)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (41g) unsweetened natural cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 and 3/4 cups (315g) semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
        <li>3/4 cup (185g) full fat sour cream or plain yogurt, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (120ml) vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (120ml) whole milk, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 and 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425°F (218°C). Spray a 12-count muffin pan with nonstick spray or use cupcake liners. This recipe yields about 14 muffins, so prepare a second muffin pan in the same manner or bake in batches and reserve leftover batter at room temperature for when the first batch is done.</li>
        <li>Whisk the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, salt, and chocolate chips together in a large bowl. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Whisk the eggs, sour cream, oil, milk, and vanilla extract together until combined. Pour wet ingredients into dry ingredients and fold together with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon until completely combined. (Batter is quite thick, so I recommend a spatula or spoon over a whisk.) Avoid overmixing. The batter will be thick and sticky.</li>
        <li>Spoon the batter into liners, filling them all the way to the top. Bake for 5 minutes at 425°F then, keeping the muffins in the oven, reduce the oven temperature to 350°F (177°C). Bake for an additional 15-16 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. The total time these muffins take in the oven is about 20-21 minutes, give or take. (For mini muffins, bake 13-14 total minutes at 350°F (177°C) the whole time.)
        </li>
        <li>Cool muffins for 10 minutes in the pan, then transfer to a wire rack until ready to eat</li>
        <li>Cover leftover muffins and store at room temperature for 5 days or in the refrigerator for 1 week.</li>
    </ol>
